    "title": "Does Defense Really Win Championships in the NFL?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over time, the sports world has coined the phrase “defense wins championships.” However, the debate continues: Does defense truly win championships?\nWhile some argue that a strong defense is the foundation for consistent success, others emphasize the importance of a high-powered offense. To determine if defense truly wins championships, we must analyze both sides of the ball for a comparative analysis.\n\n\nCode\n#Loading a GGPlot bar chart to show the defensive rankings of the last 13 Super Bowl champions. \nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = Superbowl_Defense, aes(x = reorder(Tm, Year), y = Rk, fill = Tm), stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = team_colors) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Superbowl Teams Defensive Rankings From the Last 13 Years\",\n    subtitle = \"The defensive ranking of superbowl champions by year they won the Super Bowl.\n                                                      (Lower = Better)\",\n    caption = \"By: Logan Griffiths | Source: Sports-Reference\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Defensive Rank\"\n  ) +\n  #Adjusting all of the text so that it looks cohesive with in the graph. \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 60, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.background = element_rect (fill = \"white\"),\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data provides insight into the relationship between a team’s defensive performance and being a Super Bowl champion. On average, the Super Bowl-winning teams ranked eighth defensively, showing that defense has a significant impact on a team’s ability to win a Super Bowl.\nTen of the last 13 Super Bowl winners maintained a top-10 defense. This statistic shows that while it is very beneficial to have a strong defense, some teams have managed to win without an above-average defense.\nWith that said, it is important to gauge how offense contributes to a team’s success as we examine whether defense truly wins championships. The following graph illustrates how Super Bowl champions rank on both sides of the ball.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  # Adding a pattern to show that there is a correlation whether you have a bad offense or defense and that you still fit in the mold. This code chunk will add a grey striped pattern. The red part is showing that now Super Bowl Team has been out of the Top 10 for both offense and defense. \n  geom_rect_pattern(\n    aes(xmin = 10, xmax = 25, ymin = 10, ymax = 20),\n    fill = NA, color = \"red\", pattern = \"stripe\",\n    pattern_color = \"lightgrey\", pattern_angle = 45, pattern_density = 0.05,\n    pattern_spacing = 0.01, inherit.aes = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_point(data = offenseanddefense, aes(x = Rk.x, y = Rk.y, color = Tm), size = 4) + \n  geom_text(data = offenseanddefense, \n            aes(x = Rk.x, y = Rk.y, label = Year), \n            hjust = ifelse(offenseanddefense$Year == 2014, -.5, 0.5), # Originally 2014 was overlapping 2018, so I horizontally adjusted it to align it properly.\n            vjust = ifelse(offenseanddefense$Year %in% c(2021, 2019, 2022), -2, \n                           ifelse(offenseanddefense$Year == 2014, 0, 3)), # Originally 2021,2019,2022, and 2014 were all overlapping with some dot or text. I vertically adjusted so the graph would be cleaner. \n            size = 2.5) + \n  #Annotating the red box for context.\n   annotate(\n    \"text\", x = 17.5, y = 15, label = \"No Super Bowl champion has been \n    outside the top 10 for both metrics.\",\n    color = \"black\", size = 4, hjust = 0.5\n  ) +\n  #Adding all of the labels for my chart.\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Last 13 Super Bowl Winners Offensive-Defensive Comparison \",\n    subtitle = \"Super Bowl champions' defensive and offensive ranks in the year they won.\",\n    x = \"Defensive Rank\",\n    y = \"Offensive Rank\",\n    color = \"Team\", \n    caption = \"By: Logan Griffiths | Source: Sports-Reference\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = team_colors_two) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\", \n    legend.text = element_text(size = 8), \n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.background = element_rect (fill = \"white\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data above reveals an interesting pattern in the relationship between offensive and defensive performance among Super Bowl champions. This analysis shows that it is imperative to maintain strong rankings on at least one side of the ball, with all teams placing in the top 10 either offensively or defensively.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have showed success on both sides of the ball. In their back-to-back Super Bowl appearances, they altered the way they play. In 2022, the Chiefs had a lackluster defense that ranked 16th while their offense ranked 1st.\nOn the other hand, in 2023 the scheme flipped. The Chiefs were thriving defensively while their offense performed below average. The 2023 Chiefs ranked 15th offensively and second defensively.\nInstead of requiring excellence on both sides of play, teams appear to find a way to leverage an elite performance in at least one aspect while maintaining an average performance on the other side.\nThe red box in this visualization emphasizes a critical threshold, highlight that successful teams must rank in the top 10 on at least on side of the ball to be considered contenders.\n\n\nCode\n#Representing the Yards Per Play Differential for all of the 13 teams who have won the Super Bowl since 2010. I subtracted offensive yards per play - defensive yards per play. \n#Additionally this is where I have added labels for the graph. \nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = YPP_Difference, aes(x = Year, y = YPP, fill = Tm), stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = team_colors_two) + \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(YPP_Difference$Year), max(YPP_Difference$Year), by = 1)) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Yards Per Play Dominance from the Last 13 Super Bowl Champions\",\n    subtitle = \"Tracking team efficiency by using offensive YPP - defensive YPP.\",\n    caption = \"By: Logan Griffiths | Source: Sports-Reference\",\n    x = \"Year\",\n    y = \"Yards Per Play (YPP)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"right\",\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking beyond the rankings, this metric shows how many yards per play a team gains over its opponent. This analysis of yards-per-play (YPP) differential reveals the relationship between offensive and defensive performance among championship teams.\nThe 2022 Kansas City Chiefs posted the highest YPP differential (1.30) in our sample, highlighting how a dominant offense can overcome defensive limitations. Similarly, the 2013 Seattle Seahawks achieved a high YPP differential (1.20) through their defense, proving that championship-caliber teams can succeed through either offensive or defensive dominance.\nThis analysis challenges the traditional belief that “defense wins championships.” Instead, the evidence suggests a different reality: championships are won through high-level play on either side of the ball. The consistent pattern of Super Bowl winners maintaining top-10 rankings in either offense or defense, combined with the YPP differential data, indicates that teams can achieve success despite having a lackluster offense or defense.\nThe game continues to evolve, making it naive to assume that defensive excellence alone has been the secret to success. The continuous evolution of how the game is played is best exemplified by the Kansas City Chiefs’ recent victories. They have managed to win championships with two dramatically different styled teams — first through their offense and then through their defense. This analysis shows that championship success requires constant adaptation to maximize winning potential.\nThis article suggests that rather than asking whether defense wins championships, we should recognize the excellence shown by championship teams. As the NFL continues to evolve, this flexibility in achieving success will become even more critical for a teams abillity to win a Super Bowl."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2010 San Diego Chargers were one of the most puzzling teams in recent NFL history. Despite having the No. 1-ranked offense and defense, their season was cut short due to their weakness in special teams. As a result, the Chargers finished with a disappointing 9-7 record, barely missing the playoffs.\nSo how did the 2010 Chargers miss the playoffs?\nFirst, let’s truly understand how much better they were in comparison to the rest of the league when it came to overall play on both sides of the ball.\n\n\nCode\n# this code is  creating a data set that calculates offensive yards per play.  \noffensive_yards_per_play &lt;- pbp |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(posteam)) |&gt; \n  group_by(posteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    total_offensive_yards = sum(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n    offensive_plays = n(),\n    offensive_yards_per_play = total_offensive_yards / offensive_plays\n  )\n#this code is creating a data set that calculates defensive yards per play.\ndefensive_yards_per_play &lt;- pbp |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(defteam)) |&gt; \n  group_by(defteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    total_defensive_yards_allowed = sum(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n    defensive_plays = n(),\n    defensive_yards_per_play = total_defensive_yards_allowed / defensive_plays\n  ) \n#this code is  joining the two data sets to calculate the overall yard per play differential, this metric is designed so we can see who has the best average offensive  and defensive yards combined by subtracting them for the differential.\nyards_per_play_difference &lt;- offensive_yards_per_play |&gt; \n  inner_join(\n    defensive_yards_per_play, by = c(\"posteam\" = \"defteam\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    yards_per_play_difference = offensive_yards_per_play - defensive_yards_per_play\n  ) |&gt; \n  rename(team = posteam)\n#Creating a data set for the key purpose of allowing me to color it later on. \nLAC &lt;- yards_per_play_difference |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"LAC\")\n\n#This is  me be generating the graph to highlight the Chargers elite difference in offensive yards and defensive yards compared to other NFL teams. \nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = yards_per_play_difference, \n           aes(x = reorder(team, yards_per_play_difference), y = yards_per_play_difference), \n           stat = \"identity\", fill = \"gray\") +\n   geom_bar(data = LAC, \n           aes(x = reorder(team, yards_per_play_difference), y = yards_per_play_difference), \n           stat = \"identity\", fill = \"royalblue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Chargers' Yards Per Play Differential Compared to Every NFL Team\",\n    subtitle = \"The 2010 Chargers finished 1st in the NFL in yards per play differential.\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Yards per Play Difference\",\n    caption = \"By: Logan Griffiths | Source : NFLVerse\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chargers dominated the league in yards per play differential, with a +1.44 yards per play difference between their offensive and defensive performance. The Chargers averaged 5.96 yards per offensive play (accumulating 6,343 yards on offense) while holding opponents to 4.52 yards per defensive play.\nThis differential was the largest in the NFL, significantly ahead of the second-place Pittsburgh Steelers, who posted a +1.09 differential. This Steelers team went on to play in the Super Bowl that year\nSo how can they be so good on offense and defense yet, miss the playoffs?\n\n\nCode\n#Running the Play-by-Play data fro NFLVerse\npbp &lt;- nflreadr::load_pbp(2010) |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == \"REG\")\n\n#Creating the punting data set that extracts all punting plays to get all punting statistics. \npunting_data &lt;- pbp |&gt; \n  filter(play_type == \"punt\")\n\n#Getting the total amount of punting yards for each team, while subtracting the return yards so we can get the net amount of punt yards. \nnet_punt_yards &lt;- punting_data |&gt; \n  group_by(posteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    avg_net_punt_yards = mean(kick_distance - return_yards, na.rm = TRUE)  \n  )\n#Using the data  to show the percent of punts inside of the 20 yard line.\npunts_inside_20 &lt;- punting_data |&gt; \n  group_by(posteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    pct_inside_20 = sum(punt_inside_twenty, na.rm = TRUE) / n() * 100 \n  )\n#Using thee data to show the percent of punts that are touchbacks. \npunt_touchbacks &lt;- punting_data |&gt; \n  group_by(posteam) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    pct_touchbacks = sum(touchback, na.rm = TRUE) / n() * 100 \n)\n#Joining the data sets together to make the graph\npunting_efficiency &lt;- net_punt_yards |&gt; \n  full_join(punts_inside_20, by = \"posteam\") |&gt; \n  full_join(punt_touchbacks, by = \"posteam\") |&gt; \n  rename(team = posteam)\n#Making a separate data set so I can use it later to highlight them separate. \nchargers_data &lt;- punting_efficiency |&gt; \n  filter(team == \"LAC\")\n#Making the chart. \nggplot()+\n  geom_point(\n    data = punting_efficiency,\n    aes(x = avg_net_punt_yards, y = pct_inside_20),\n    color = \"grey\", size = 3, shape = 16\n  )+\n  geom_text(\n    data = punting_efficiency,\n    aes(x = avg_net_punt_yards, y = pct_inside_20, label =team),\n    size = 2, vjust = -0.5, color = \"black\"\n  )+\n  geom_point(\n    data = chargers_data,\n    aes(x = avg_net_punt_yards, y = pct_inside_20),\n    color = \"royalblue\", size = 3, shape = 16\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Chargers' Punting Efficiency Struggles\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing the Chargers punt yards and touchback rate to the other teams in the NFL.\",\n    x = \"Average Net Punt Yards\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Punts Inside the 20\",\n    caption = \"By: Logan Griffiths | Source: NFLVerse\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#|message: FALSE\n#|include: FALSE\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nThe answer lies in their awful punting. The Chargers averaged just 33.96 net yards per punt ranking dead last in the NFL. On top of that they were 6 yards under the league average.\nNot only was their average punting yards low, but their ability to pin their opponents behind the 20-yard line was equally bad, with only a 23.21%. Making things worse, they led the league with a 16.07% touchback rate, consistently giving up opportunities to pin opponents deep in their own territory.\nTo fully understand the impact of these struggles, we need to examine how the poor touchback rate and inability to pin opponents inside the 20-yard line contributed to their field position disadvantage.\n\n\nCode\n#|message: false\n#|include: True\n#Using the Punting Data given by Sports Reference as well to make a total yards given up metric. \npunting_data &lt;- X2010Punting |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Return_Yards_Given_Up = RetYds\n  )\n#Making a separate data set to visualize where the chargers are on this list. \nchargers_data &lt;- punting_data |&gt; \n   filter(Tm == \"San Diego Chargers\")\n#Making the return yards against visualization.\nggplot()+\n geom_bar(\n    data = punting_data,\n    aes(x = reorder(Tm, Return_Yards_Given_Up), y = Return_Yards_Given_Up), \n    stat = \"identity\", fill = \"gray\"\n  ) +\n    geom_bar(\n    data = chargers_data, \n    aes(x = reorder(Tm, Return_Yards_Given_Up), y = Return_Yards_Given_Up), \n    stat = \"identity\", fill = \"royalblue\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Chargers' Struggles with Punt Coverage\",\n    subtitle = \"How the Chargers' opponent return yards allowed compare to other NFL teams.\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    y = \"Punt Yards - Return Yards\",\n    caption = \"By: Logan Griffiths| Sports Reference\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite punting only 56 times (the third-fewest attempts) the Chargers still gave up 538 return yards, the fifth-most in the league. The only way that the Chargers could effectively stop their opponent from returning a punt deep was by getting touch backs. Even more concerning they, had four blocked punts, while no other team had more than two; making up 30% of the blocked punts that year.Sports Reference\nSo truly what could have been their record if it wasn’t for their awful punting?\n\n\nCode\n#Also note for Collin Berke, I was getting weird formatting when I was exporting this CSV from Sports Reference so I decided to just manually import everything myself because it just became easier. \n\n#Making a custom data frame to show the week by week progressions of the Chargers, I had to do it this way because I was getting errors in the way that it was formatted. \nchargers_schedule &lt;- data.frame(\n  Week = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17),\n  H_or_A = c(\"Away\", \"Home\", \"Away\", \"Home\", \"Away\", \"Home\", \"Home\", \"Away\", \"Home\", \"Bye\", \n              \"Home\", \"Away\", \"Home\", \"Away\", \"Home\", \"Away\", \"Home\"),\n  Opponent = c(\"Kansas City Chiefs\", \"Jacksonville Jaguars\", \"Seattle Seahawks\", \n               \"Arizona Cardinals\", \"Oakland Raiders\", \"St. Louis Rams\", \n               \"New England Patriots\", \"Tennessee Titans\", \"Houston Texans\", \"Bye\", \n               \"Denver Broncos\", \"Indianapolis Colts\", \"Oakland Raiders\", \n               \"Kansas City Chiefs\", \"San Francisco 49ers\", \"Cincinnati Bengals\", \n               \"Denver Broncos\"),\n  Chargers = c(14, 38, 20, 41, 27, 17, 23, 33, 29, NA, \n               35, 36, 13, 31, 34, 20, 23),\n  Opponent_Score = c(21, 13, 27, 10, 35, 20, 27, 25, 23, NA, \n                     14, 14, 28, 0, 7, 34, 21),\n  Rec = c(\"0-1\", \"1-1\", \"1-2\", \"2-2\", \"2-3\", \"2-4\", \"3-4\", \"4-4\", \"5-4\", \"5-4\", \n          \"6-4\", \"7-4\", \"7-5\", \"8-5\", \"9-5\", \"9-6\", \"9-7\")\n)\n\n#Making a formula for the Win/Loss category based of the score of the Chargers and their Opponents. \nchargers_schedule &lt;- chargers_schedule |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    Result = case_when(\n      Chargers &gt; Opponent_Score ~ \"Win\",\n      Chargers &lt; Opponent_Score ~ \"Loss\"\n    ),\n    Point_Differential = Chargers - Opponent_Score\n  )\n#Making the Table  of the Chargers Win/Loss progression through the record. \nchargers_schedule_gt &lt;- chargers_schedule |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \" Chargers Lost  Because of Bad Punting\" ,\n    subtitle = \"Showing which games were strictly decided because of their awful special teams units. \"\n  ) |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Week = \"Week\",\n    H_or_A = \"Home/Away\",\n    Opponent = \"Opponent\",\n    Chargers = \"Chargers Score\",\n    Opponent_Score = \"Opponent Score\",\n    Result = \"Result\",\n    Rec = \"Record\",\n    Point_Differential = \"Point Differential\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By: Logan Griffiths |Source: [Sports Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sdg/2010.htm)\")\n  ) |&gt; \ntab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(rows = Week %in% c(1, 3, 5))\n)\nchargers_schedule_gt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChargers Lost Because of Bad Punting\n\n\nShowing which games were strictly decided because of their awful special teams units.\n\n\nWeek\nHome/Away\nOpponent\nChargers Score\nOpponent Score\nRecord\nResult\nPoint Differential\n\n\n\n\n1\nAway\nKansas City Chiefs\n14\n21\n0-1\nLoss\n-7\n\n\n2\nHome\nJacksonville Jaguars\n38\n13\n1-1\nWin\n25\n\n\n3\nAway\nSeattle Seahawks\n20\n27\n1-2\nLoss\n-7\n\n\n4\nHome\nArizona Cardinals\n41\n10\n2-2\nWin\n31\n\n\n5\nAway\nOakland Raiders\n27\n35\n2-3\nLoss\n-8\n\n\n6\nHome\nSt. Louis Rams\n17\n20\n2-4\nLoss\n-3\n\n\n7\nHome\nNew England Patriots\n23\n27\n3-4\nLoss\n-4\n\n\n8\nAway\nTennessee Titans\n33\n25\n4-4\nWin\n8\n\n\n9\nHome\nHouston Texans\n29\n23\n5-4\nWin\n6\n\n\n10\nBye\nBye\nNA\nNA\n5-4\nNA\nNA\n\n\n11\nHome\nDenver Broncos\n35\n14\n6-4\nWin\n21\n\n\n12\nAway\nIndianapolis Colts\n36\n14\n7-4\nWin\n22\n\n\n13\nHome\nOakland Raiders\n13\n28\n7-5\nLoss\n-15\n\n\n14\nAway\nKansas City Chiefs\n31\n0\n8-5\nWin\n31\n\n\n15\nHome\nSan Francisco 49ers\n34\n7\n9-5\nWin\n27\n\n\n16\nAway\nCincinnati Bengals\n20\n34\n9-6\nLoss\n-14\n\n\n17\nHome\nDenver Broncos\n23\n21\n9-7\nWin\n2\n\n\n\nBy: Logan Griffiths |Source: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2010 Chargers’ season presents us with a “what-if” scenario that truly shows the impact of having an awful special teams unit.\nThe Week 1 loss to the Chiefs (14-21) was simply due to a punt return touchdown, giving Kansas City the free seven-point win. Week 3’s defeat in Seattle (20-27) had another returned touchdown that gave the Seahawks a seven-point win. However, the most upsetting example came in Week 5 against the Oakland Raiders, were two blocked punts (one resulting in a safety and another returned for a touchdown) creating a add nine-point deficit in what ended as a 27-35 loss.\nIf the Chargers had a special teams unit that was serviceable or just the league-average, they could have reasonably won at least two or three additional games, potentially converting their 9-7 record to a 11-5 or 12-4 record.\nThe difference between the Chargers making the playoffs and not making the playoffs was simply their entire scheme when it came to their punting."
