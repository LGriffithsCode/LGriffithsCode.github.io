Despite having the No.1 ranked offense and defense, their season was cut short due to their weakness in special teams. As a result, the Chargers finished with a disappointing record 9-7 record, barely missing the playoffs.\nFor reference there has been one other team that has accomplished this feat, that was the 1996 Green Bay Packers not only went to the Playoffs but won the Super Bowl that year.\n\n\nCode\nchargers_schedule_gt &lt;- chargers_schedule |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"San Diego Chargers 2010 Season Schedue\",\n    subtitle = \"pending\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Week = \"Week\",\n    H_or_A = \"Home/Away\",\n    Opponent = \"Opponent\",\n    Chargers = \"Chargers Score\",\n    Opponent_Score = \"Opponent Score\",\n    Result = \"Result\",\n    Rec = \"Record\",\n    Point_Differential = \"Point Differential\"\n  ) |&gt; \n tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By: Logan Griffiths\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Source: [Sports Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sdg/2010.htm)\")\n  ) |&gt; \n tab_style(\n  style = cell_text(color = \"green3\"),\n  locations = cells_body(columns = \"Result\", rows = Result == \"Win\")\n) |&gt; \ntab_style(\n  style = cell_text(color = \"red3\"),\n  locations = cells_body(columns = \"Result\", rows = Result == \"Loss\")\n)\nchargers_schedule_gt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Diego Chargers 2010 Season Schedue\n\n\npending\n\n\nWeek\nHome/Away\nOpponent\nChargers Score\nOpponent Score\nRecord\nResult\nPoint Differential\n\n\n\n\n1\nAway\nKansas City Chiefs\n14\n21\n0-1\nLoss\n-7\n\n\n2\nHome\nJacksonville Jaguars\n38\n13\n1-1\nWin\n25\n\n\n3\nAway\nSeattle Seahawks\n20\n27\n1-2\nLoss\n-7\n\n\n4\nHome\nArizona Cardinals\n41\n10\n2-2\nWin\n31\n\n\n5\nAway\nOakland Raiders\n27\n35\n2-3\nLoss\n-8\n\n\n6\nHome\nSt. Louis Rams\n17\n20\n2-4\nLoss\n-3\n\n\n7\nHome\nNew England Patriots\n23\n27\n3-4\nLoss\n-4\n\n\n8\nAway\nTennessee Titans\n33\n25\n3-5\nWin\n8\n\n\n9\nHome\nHouston Texans\n29\n23\n4-5\nWin\n6\n\n\n10\nAway\nDenver Broncos\n35\n14\n4-6\nWin\n21\n\n\n11\nHome\nIndianapolis Colts\n36\n14\n5-6\nWin\n22\n\n\n12\nAway\nOakland Raiders\n13\n28\n5-7\nLoss\n-15\n\n\n13\nHome\nKansas City Chiefs\n31\n0\n6-7\nWin\n31\n\n\n14\nAway\nSan Francisco 49ers\n34\n7\n6-8\nWin\n27\n\n\n15\nHome\nCincinnati Bengals\n20\n34\n7-8\nLoss\n-14\n\n\n16\nAway\nDenver Broncos\n20\n23\n7-9\nLoss\n-3\n\n\n17\nHome\nTennessee Titans\n23\n21\n8-9\nWin\n2\n\n\n\nBy: Logan Griffiths\n\n\nSource: Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first question we’ll have to ask in order to find out how bad their special teams was, Where did their punting compare to all 32 teams.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(punting_efficiency, aes(x = avg_net_punt_yards, y = pct_inside_20)) +\n  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team), width = 0.05, alpha = 1) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"grey\", linetype = \"dashed\", se = FALSE) +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"2010 NFL Punting Efficiency\",\n    x = \"Average Net Punt Yards\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Punts Inside the 20\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"
